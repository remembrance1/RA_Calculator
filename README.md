# Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool

### Introduction

The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT) is based on a statistical model known as the Gail Model, named after Dr. Mitchell Gail, Senior Investigator in the Biostatistics Branch of the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics

The tool uses a womanâ€™s own personal information to estimate risk of developing invasive breast cancer over specific periods of time, including:

  * Age
  * Age at the start of menstruation
  * Age at first live birth of a child
  * Number of first-degree relative (mother, sisters, daughters) with breast cancer
  * Number of previous breast biopsies (whether positive or negative)
  * Presence of atypical hyperplasia in a biopsy
  
### Application

The application consists of two panels, one for user-input on clinical & demographic information whereas the other is a results panel.
