The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT) is based on a statistical
model known as the Gail Model, named after Dr. Mitchell Gail, Senior
Investigator in the Biostatistics Branch of the NCI Division of Cancer
Epidemiology and Genetics

The tool uses a woman’s own personal information to estimate risk of
developing invasive breast cancer over specific periods of time,
including:

-   Age
-   Age at the start of menstruation
-   Age at first live birth of a child
-   Number of first-degree relative (mother, sisters, daughters) with
    breast cancer
-   Number of previous breast biopsies (whether positive or negative)
-   Presence of atypical hyperplasia in a biopsy

Data from the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP), a
joint NCI and American Cancer Society breast cancer screening study that
involved 280,000 white women aged 35 to 74 years, and from the NCI
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, were used in
developing the model.

Estimates for black/African American women were based on data from the
Women’s Contraceptive and Reproductive Experiences (CARE) Study and from
SEER data. CARE participants included 1,607 women with invasive breast
cancer and 1,637 without.

Estimates for Asian and Pacific Islander women in the United States were
based on data from the Asian American Breast Cancer Study (AABCS) and
SEER data. AABCS participants included 597 Asian and Pacific Islander
women with invasive breast cancer, and 966 women without breast cancer.

Estimates for Hispanic women were based on the San Francisco Bay Area
Breast Cancer Study (SFBCS) and the California Cancer Registry and SEER
Program. SFBCS participants included 1,086 women with invasive breast
cancer and 1,411 women without breast cancer.

### Testing the Model

The Gail Model has been tested in large populations of white women and
has been shown to provide accurate estimates of breast cancer risk. The
model was tested for Asian and Pacific Islander women, black/African
American, and Hispanic women using data from the Women’s Health
Initiative. It performed well but may underestimate risk in
black/African American women with previous biopsies and Hispanic women
born outside the United States. &gt; <span style="color:red">Women who
received radiation for the treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma have higher
than average risk of breast cancer. These risks are discussed in the
scientific manuscript Travis, L.B et al. (J Natl Cancer Inst 2005;
97:1428-37)</span>.

The model needs further validation for Hispanic women and other
subgroups. More data is required to train the model.

### Future Plans

-   Future work can be carried out to include pateints with a history of
    breast cancer or lobular carcinoma in situ or ductal carcinoma in
    situ.
